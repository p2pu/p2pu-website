## Web Designer (Contract position)

We are looking for an independent web designer who can work with us to ensure our software and materials are visually satisfying and cohesive. We’re looking for somebody to engage from time to time on a contract basis for several projects throughout the year. At first, you will help us integrate our primary project, [learning circles](https://learningcircles.p2pu.org), with our [homepage](https://www.p2pu.org). You will help define the work to be done and implement the changes in HTML and CSS.

P2PU developed learning circles as a lightly facilitated study group model to offer an opportunity for adults to engage with online learning in a social setting (such as public libraries). Our work is rooted in the conviction that online learning, coupled with peer learning networks can challenge the exclusivity of traditional educational institutions and support empowering learning experiences for people around the world. 

To support learning circles, we build software for facilitators, conduct training workshops, develop and curate open educational resources, and support libraries and other community centers as nodes for online learning.

## Experience & Qualifications

 - Tech skills - You are fluent in HTML, CSS, know some JavaScript and worked with SASS before. You can check your code in on GitHub and have worked with other developers.
 - Visual identity - You know the Adobe suite of tools well and are comfortable mocking up everything from flyers to homepages.
 - User research and software design - You have experience conducting user research and leading user-testing sessions as part of a development process.
 - Prototyping - You are comfortable prototyping things and pushing those things into production.
 - Learning and education - You have some experience, or at least a strong interest, working in the field of learning/education. Teaching, curriculum development, online learning design, and facilitation experience are all pluses. 

## To Apply
Please send your portfolio, resume, and rate to <thepeople@p2pu.org> with the subject line “Web Design Consultant”.
