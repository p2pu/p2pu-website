    <h3>OBJECTIVES</h3>
    <p>The primary objective of the fellowship is to equip participants with the skills, knowledge, and tools necessary to effectively facilitate community-based learning programs. By focusing on peer learning and facilitation techniques, the fellowship aims to foster lifelong learning and create environments that are both inclusive and engaging for diverse communities.</p>

    <h3>OUTCOMES</h3>
    <p>Fellows will gain hands-on experience by designing and executing a public learning program tailored to their communityâ€™s needs. To ensure the success and impact of these programs, each project will undergo a comprehensive 3-month review and retrospective, providing valuable insights and areas for growth.</p>
 
    <h3>FORMAT</h3>
    <p>The fellowship spans three months and includes six virtual meetings held bi-weekly. These sessions are designed to cover essential facilitation skills and peer learning methodologies.
