  - quote: "I joined a learning circle so I could be in an environment where everyone is vested in the work and progress. Also, being able to share and receive feedback under the guidance of an engaged instructor-leader was a blessing!"

  - quote: "The very act of making education accessible, free, and learner-driven is the heart of democracy. Here in Chicago, an incredibly segregated city, I've seen learning circles be agents of social justice: they have brought people of all races, ages, and social classes, and helped them form bonds they might otherwise not have the opportunity to form."
