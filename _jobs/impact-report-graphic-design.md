## Background

Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a grassroots non-profit organization that supports peer-learning communities in public spaces like libraries around the world. We focus on a pedagogical model we call learning circles: lightly-facilitated study groups that meet regularly to work through open-access learning resources. These groups have traditionally been held face-to-face in public spaces like libraries but have expanded to meeting online.

P2PU is creating its first ever impact report with a 5 year look back to highlight the work we’ve done and the impact it has had on individual learners, facilitators and communities around the world.  We’re looking to create a PDF based report to share with our community, funders and other collaborators. Our budget for this project is $2,500 USD.

## Process & timeline

- Week 1
    - Initial project kickoff / brief to share/finalize the report outline
- Week 2 & 3
    - Initial design draft of report (basic layout, image assets)
    - Implementation of feedback on 1st draft (most images finalized)
- Week 4
    - Report to be updated with finalized content
    - Correction of any errors
- Week 5
    - Final signoff & handover of all source assets

## Deliverables
- Finalized PDF
- PDF source doc (indesign files)
- Images used in report

## Design constraints
The P2PU Learning Circle Promo Kit, shows our collage style and also has copies of our logos in P2PU color concepts.  We would like our report design to be inline with these themes.
