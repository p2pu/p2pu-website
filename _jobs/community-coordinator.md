    We are looking for a part-time community coordinator to join our small distributed team. You will help us foster and grow our community of partners, facilitators, learners and other members around the world. This is an exciting opportunity to make a big contribution in a small team.

    ### Background

    Peer 2 Peer University (P2PU) is a U.S.-based non-profit organization that supports community-based alternatives to mainstream formal education. Since 2015, we’ve been running learning circles: in-person study groups for people who want to learn something together. Learning circles currently meet in public libraries and community centers around the world: our partners include public library systems in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, Kansas City, Charlotte, Los Angeles, Toronto, Berlin, Cologne, and Braga (PT) as well as national organizations in Kenya, Poland, Romania, and Finland.

    P2PU’s role supporting learning circles is multi-faceted: we build open source software to support in-person learning communities, we train individuals to facilitate learning circles and maintain a virtual facilitator community of practice, we develop and curate open educational resources, and we help our partners build new pathways for community-based learning in their towns and cities.

    You will join our small distributed team to work closely alongside librarians, designers, researchers, and educators. Operationally we are a 2-person team, based in Detroit, MI, and Cape Town. This is a part-time (20 hours/week) contract for 3 months with the hope and intent to extend. Compensation is between $20 and $25 per hour. You can be based anywhere.

    - Contribute to the development of one or more newsletters, sharing relevant community updates, success stories, and important announcements.
    - Create a more structured format for sharing community stories and develop templates for sharing these stories on various social media platforms, including Instagram, X, and LinkedIn.
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of the current community strategy, identifying the community's demographics, engagement activities, strengths, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. 
    - Handle daily tasks such as scheduling and attending meetings, providing support to community members, offering weekly updates, and managing social media accounts.

    ### Qualifications & requirements

    - Experience in community engagement.
    - Proficiency in social media management.
    - Excellent organizational and project management skills.
    - Analytical skills to review and optimize community strategies.
    - Familiarity with learning circles is a plus
